# PolicyApplicatorForIntune
Configure any app you like using OMA-DM. This little tool will automatically convert configuration files (currently xml, ini and lists) into ready to use Intune configuration profiles that you can simply deploy. The tool consists out of 3 components that allow you the creation, upload and application of policies.

This project is currently in alpha status. We have a working client that can be deployed as Win32 App or MSI LoB and some scripts that generate ready to use policy templates.

However the code is still a little dirty so don't judge me ;).
